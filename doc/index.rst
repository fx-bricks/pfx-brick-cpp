PFx Brick C++ API
=================

The **pfxbrick** python package provides an easy to use API for communicating with USB attached PFx Bricks. The API provides the following capabilities:

* Enumeration of PFx Bricks, session open/close with specific PFx Brick

* Readback and modification of PFx Brick configuration, event/action LUT

* File System access

* Motor, Lighting, and Sound actions

* Low level hardware access

Details on the PFx Brick and its communication protocol can be found in the `PFx Brick Interface Control Document (ICD) <https://www.fxbricks.com//downloads/PFxBrickICD-Rev3.36.pdf>`_.  This comprehensive document fundamentally describes the operation of the PFx Brick and is used to develop both the firmware and host software APIs designed to communicate with the PFx Brick.
